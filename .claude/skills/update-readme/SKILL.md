# Update README

Refresh an existing `README.md` using current codebase state, git history, and
changelog intelligence. Always updates `CHANGELOG.md` first so changelog content
is available when revising README sections.

## Step 1 — Check README Existence

Glob for `README.md`, `readme.md`, and `Readme.md` in the working directory.

If not found, or if the file has fewer than 5 lines of real content:
- Inform the user no substantial README was found
- Invoke `Skill: claude-coding:make-readme`
- Stop — make-readme handles creation from scratch

If a substantial README exists: continue.

## Step 2 — Update Changelog

Invoke `Skill: claude-coding:make-changelog`.

make-changelog detects fill mode automatically — it adds only versions missing
since the last documented entry. If the repo has no git history, make-changelog
will report an error; note it and continue without changelog context.

## Step 3 — Parallel Research

Record the current README line count before edits.

Launch the three agents below **in a single message** (all in parallel):

**Agent A — README Audit** (`subagent_type: Explore`)

Prompt:
```
Read README.md. For each section (every H1/H2/H3 heading), record:
- Section name and approximate line count
- Stale content: version numbers, paths, commands, or features that look incorrect
- Placeholder text never replaced (e.g. "YOUR_USERNAME", "TODO", angle-bracket values)
- Thin sections with fewer than 3 lines of real content

Also identify which standard sections are MISSING:
installation, usage, configuration, API reference, contributing, license.

Return structured notes:
- existing_sections: list of heading names
- stale_items: list of {location, description} objects
- missing_sections: list
- thin_sections: list
```

**Agent B — Codebase Scan** (`subagent_type: Explore`)

Prompt:
```
Scan the working directory to extract:
- Project name and current version from the first found manifest:
  package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, .claude-plugin/plugin.json
- Primary language and framework (file extensions, config files)
- Top-level directory structure, max 2 levels deep
- Key public-facing files: entry points, config templates, example files, CLI scripts
- Documentation files beyond README: CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.

Return: project_name, version, language, framework, structure_summary,
key_files (paths), extra_docs (paths).
```

**Agent C — Git History Since Last README Touch** (`subagent_type: Explore`)

Prompt:
```
Run: git log --follow -1 --format="%ai" -- README.md
This gives the date README.md was last committed.
If README.md has no git history, use the initial commit date:
  git log --reverse --format="%ai" | head -1

Then run: git log --since="[date from above]" --format="%s" --no-merges

Categorize each commit subject into:
- new_features: new capabilities users can invoke
- breaking_changes: removed or incompatible changes
- deprecations: features flagged for future removal
- significant_fixes: user-visible bug fixes
- other: everything else

Skip: merge commits, CI/CD changes, formatting/whitespace, version-bump commits.

Return: readme_last_updated (ISO date), changes_since (object with 5 category lists).
```

Wait for all three agents to complete before Step 4.

## Step 4 — Read Updated Changelog

Read `CHANGELOG.md` and extract the most recent version section (the first `## [x.y.z]`
block). This provides structured change context for README sections like Features.

## Step 5 — Synthesize and Update

Apply targeted updates to `README.md`. Preserve existing style, header format,
badge patterns, and overall structure — do not restructure unless clearly broken.

Apply in this priority order — highest-confidence fixes first, judgment-heavy
additions last, because objective errors (wrong version, broken path) have
deterministic answers while structural additions require codebase context to get right:

1. **Version/badge updates** — update all version numbers and shields.io badge
   URLs to the version from Agent B
2. **Stale content** — correct outdated paths, commands, flags, or removed features
   flagged by Agent A
3. **Placeholder cleanup** — replace any unfilled placeholders with real values
   from Agent B
4. **New features** — add or expand the Features section using Agent C's
   `new_features` list and the latest CHANGELOG section
5. **Missing sections** — add any standard sections identified by Agent A as
   absent, with minimal viable content drawn from Agent B's codebase scan
6. **Thin sections** — expand underdeveloped sections using Agent B context

If no updates are needed after applying all criteria, skip edits and proceed to Step 6.

For each change, make the smallest edit that achieves accuracy. Use `Edit` for
targeted section updates — it preserves git blame and is safer for incremental
changes. Use `Write` only if more than 60% of the file changes, because at that
point the document is being regenerated, not updated.

## Step 6 — Report

Output a diff summary after writing:
- Line count: N → M lines
- Sections updated: list with one-line description of each change
- Sections added: list
- Sections removed: list with reason (if any)
- Version bumped: old → new (if applicable)
- Changelog: versions added by make-changelog
